## Introduction

In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, efficient resource management is crucial for web applications. This simulation helps users visualize and understand how threading works in a web server context. It demonstrates how a thread pool can efficiently handle multiple requests while managing resources effectively.

## Features

- **Thread Pool Management**: Efficiently manages a pool of threads to handle incoming requests.
- **Queue Handling**: Implements a queue system to manage requests, ensuring that they are processed in an orderly manner.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring of server performance and thread activity.
- **Load Testing**: Simulates multiple users accessing the server to test its performance under load.
- **Postman Collection**: Includes a Postman collection for easy testing of the server endpoints.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a range of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the server.
- **Python**: The programming language used for server-side logic.
- **Threading**: For managing concurrent requests.
- **Queue Simulation**: To handle incoming requests efficiently.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: For monitoring server performance.
- **Postman**: For testing the server endpoints.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sabel200110/thread-management-simulation.git
   cd thread-management-simulation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the server**:
   Execute the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

You can now access the server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

After starting the server, you can interact with it using various endpoints. Here are some common operations:

- **Start a new request**: Send a request to the server to initiate processing.
- **Check status**: Query the server to check the status of ongoing requests.
- **Monitor performance**: Access the real-time monitoring dashboard to view server metrics.

Refer to the [Postman Collection](#postman-collection) for detailed examples of how to interact with the server.

## Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

The real-time monitoring dashboard provides insights into the server's performance. It displays key metrics such as:

- **Active Threads**: The number of threads currently handling requests.
- **Queue Length**: The number of requests waiting to be processed.
- **Response Times**: Average response times for completed requests.

To access the dashboard, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard` after starting the server.

## Load Testing

Load testing is crucial for understanding how your server performs under pressure. This simulation allows you to simulate multiple users accessing the server simultaneously. You can adjust the number of simulated users and the duration of the test to see how the server responds.

To initiate a load test, use the following endpoint:
```
POST /load-test
```
This endpoint accepts parameters to configure the load test.

## Postman Collection

A Postman collection is included to help you test the server endpoints easily. You can import the collection into Postman and run the predefined requests. This simplifies the process of testing and interacting with the server.
